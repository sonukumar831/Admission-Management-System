After reorganisation of Patna University and establishment of Ranchi University in 1960, it was affiliated to Ranchi University. BIT Sindri was later affiliated to Vinoba Bhave University after establishment of Vinoba Bhave University at Hazaribagh in September 1992. Currently, it is affiliated to Jharkhand University of Technology.[1] With the partition of Bihar in 2000, BIT Sindri was named Birsa Institute of Technology, but later decided to be referred only as BIT Sindri because of historical importance of its name.[2]</p>
