                The department offers a four-year B. Tech course for undergraduates ingraining challenges and innovation across many fields. It was established as a platform to showcase and enhance technical excellence in all the Areas of electronics and communication engineering. It provides industrial exposure to Engaging topics like 5G research and technology to initiate overall development.
                To enhance the enthusiasm of innovative minds, the ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING SOCIETY has been Established this year to host numerous seminars, cultural fests, quizzes, competitions, workshops, and various technical activities. This action was Intended to draw in curious minds and offer a road map for their future.</p>
            <h3>Mechanical engineering</h3>
            <p>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.
                Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.[2][3]</p>
            <h3>Civil Engineering</h3>
            <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.[1][2]
                Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.[5]</p>
            <h3>Chemical engineering</h3>
            <p>Established in 1956, the Department of Chemical Engineering is one of the oldest Disciplines at BIT Sindri. It grew over the years and set very high standards for educating aspiring Chemical Engineers and Scholars. The department offers a four-year B.Tech degree course and a Postgraduate program for an M.Tech degree with a specialization in Chemical Plant Design in Engineering. The National Board Of Accreditation (NBA) has accredited the B.Tech program for the next two years in 2021. The department features highly qualified and experienced faculties dedicated to teaching and promoting Research and Development in basic and advanced areas. Since its establishment, a well-balanced curriculum of theory and practice and well-equipped laboratories, such as the Unit operations lab, process control lab, Petroleum refinery engineering lab, and Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics lab, have been its defining characteristics.</p>
            <h3>Production engineering</h3>
            <p>The Production & Industrial Engineering Department of BIT Sindri (formerly known as Production Engineering), is the first of its kind in Asia, was started in the year 1955 to offer a multidisciplinary academic program for four years B. Tech. program in Production Engineering. Ensuing, it was changed to the Production & Industrial Engineering Department to comprehend its ambit through which students can get a wide range overview of the real-world industry practices for increasing efficiency and productivity, strides towards solving complex problems, cost-effectiveness, quality control, etc.; along with the manufacturing processes. In its long expedition, the department has successfully secured its strong links with renowned industries of the country, R&D organizations, consultancy organizations, and academic institutes in the region. The faculty members have an unremitting spirit and are actively engaged in research and development activities many of which are funded by external agencies.
                The curriculum of Production & Industrial Engineering is an interdisciplinary engineering discipline that includes manufacturing technology, engineering sciences, management science, and optimization of complex processes, systems, or organizations. It is a perfect blend of manufacturing processes and production methodology.</p>
            <h3>Mining engineering</h3>
            <p>BIT Sindri’s Mining Technology Division was established by the Government of Bihar in 1975 to oversee the vast and diverse mineral reserves of Bihar (now Jharkhand). As a corollary of the nationalization of the mineral industry, in the 1970s there was also an urgent need to meet the need for large numbers of trained and qualified mining engineers. The department began by initially enrolling his 25 students in a four-year course, then expanded to 49 students per year by his AICTE in New Delhi. Since its establishment, the department has actively contributed with well-trained and effective products and experienced teachers in the field of coal and non-coal mining in management, planning, and research and development. The Department has the unique geographical advantage of being located between the main mining companies of the country as well as famous national and international research agencies and organizations such as BCCL, CCL, ECL, CMPDIL, CIMFR, IIT (ISM), TATA STEEL Ltd., SAIL, NML, etc. The Faculty is honored to enjoy the presence of such large and well-known institutions through the regular interaction of industry experts with students as well as faculty. The Faculty of Mining Engineering has, over its 44 years of existence, developed its own curriculum and extensive laboratory facilities that are relevant to the current requirements of the mining and related industries in the country and in the current context as per the global scene. The Faculty has laboratories with modern facilities, viz., Rock mechanics, Mining ventilation, Mine environmental engineering, Mining systems, Mining machinery, Mine surveying as well as Mine geology. Constantly striving to improve every aspect of the school, extracurricular and extracurricular activities to maintain its position among the top leagues in the country.</p>
            <h3>Metallurgical engineering</h3>
            <p>The department was established in 1956. Since then, B.I.T. Sindri has had a rich heritage of producing and shaping world-class metallurgists. The department of Metallurgical Engineering is NBA accredited. The department runs one undergraduate course in Metallurgical Engineering, and 02 postgraduate courses with a specialization on Metallurgical & Materials Engineering and Material Engineering (Nano Technology). The metallurgists of this department are constantly striving to uplift the operative professors, interactive alumni, and enthusiastic students that together comprise the Department of Metallurgy. Over the years, the department has developed excellent expertise in the areas of Extractive Metallurgy, Physical Metallurgy, Mechanical Metallurgy, Mechanical behavior of Materials, Nano-science and Technology, Powder Metallurgy, Environmental Degradation of Materials, etc. In keeping with its tradition of producing world-class metallurgists, the department has actively diversified to adopt today’s teaching and learning tools to address today’s technological challenges in various fields. The department has provided the necessary manpower for the sustainable development of India. The department has provided the best manpower which is the backbone of the steel industry.
