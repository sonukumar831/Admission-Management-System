It was established as a platform to showcase and enhance technical excellence in all the Areas of electronics and communication engineering. It provides industrial exposure to Engaging topics like 5G research and technology to initiate overall development.
                To enhance the enthusiasm of innovative minds, the ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING SOCIETY has been Established this year to host numerous seminars, cultural fests, quizzes, competitions, workshops, and various technical activities. This action was Intended to draw in curious minds and offer a road map for their future.</p>
            <h3>Mechanical engineering</h3>
            <p>Mechanical engineering is the study of physical machines that may involve force and movement. It is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science, to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.
                Mechanical engineering requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, design, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.[2][3]</p>
            <h3>Civil Engineering</h3>
            <p>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.[1][2]
                Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.[5]</p>
            <h3>Chemical engineering</h3>
            <p>Established in 1956, the Department of Chemical Engineering is one of the oldest Disciplines at BIT Sindri. It grew over the years and set very high standards for educating aspiring Chemical Engineers and Scholars. The department offers a four-year B.Tech degree course and a Postgraduate program for an M.Tech degree with a specialization in Chemical Plant Design in Engineering. The National Board Of Accreditation (NBA) has accredited the B.Tech program for the next two years in 2021. The department features highly qualified and experienced faculties dedicated to teaching and promoting Research and Development in basic and advanced areas. Since its establishment, a well-balanced curriculum of theory and practice and well-equipped laboratories, such as the Unit operations lab, process control lab, Petroleum refinery engineering lab, and Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics lab, have been its defining characteristics.</p>
            <h3>Production engineering</h3>
            <p>The Production & Industrial Engineering Department of BIT Sindri (formerly known as Production Engineering), is the first of its kind in Asia, was started in the year 1955 to offer a multidisciplinary academic program for four years B. Tech. program in Production Engineering. Ensuing, it was changed to the Production & Industrial Engineering Department to comprehend its ambit through which students can get a wide range overview of the real-world industry practices for increasing efficiency and productivity, strides towards solving complex problems, cost-effectiveness, quality control, etc.; along with the manufacturing processes. In its long expedition, the department has successfully secured its strong links with renowned industries of the country, R&D organizations, consultancy organizations, and academic institutes in the region. The faculty members have an unremitting spirit and are actively engaged in research and development activities many of which are funded by external agencies.
                The curriculum of Production & Industrial Engineering is an interdisciplinary engineering discipline that includes manufacturing technology, engineering sciences, management science, and optimization of complex processes, systems, or organizations. It is a perfect blend of manufacturing processes and production methodology.</p>
            <h3>Mining engineering</h3>
            <p>BIT Sindriâ€™s Mining Technology Division was established by the Government of Bihar in 1975 to oversee the vast and diverse mineral reserves of Bihar (now Jharkhand). As a corollary of the nationalization of the mineral industry, in the 1970s there was also an urgent need to meet the need for large numbers of trained and qualified mining engineers. The department began by initially enrolling his 25 students in a four-year course, then expanded to 49 students per year by his AICTE in New Delhi. Since its establishment, the department has actively contributed with well-trained and effective products and experienced teachers in the field of coal and non-coal mining in management, planning, and research and development.
